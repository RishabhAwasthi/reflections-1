*What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
 to create git
adfs
*How is the staging area different fdsfadfsarom the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
staging area is an intermediate place between working directory and the existing files.first we put the 
files into staging area then commit them.

*How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
by yousing git diff i can see the diff btw the current and the stage file

*What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
if you want to start a new feature
*How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
by making it easy to see what can be accesed and all

*What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?
if we were succesfull doing that feature we might want to merge it


*What are the pros and cons of Git’s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
